A sample program to show Meyers Singleton Pattern.

Meyers Singleton Pattern:
1. Place constructors and assignment in private section.
2. Define a static class member function that returns the reference to static instance variable.
3. Get the singleton object reference Singleton& inst = Singleton::getInstance()
